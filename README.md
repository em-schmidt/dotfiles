dotfiles revamp for 2021

I'm working on a mac generally and this repo is only used for that environment.

using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) instead of older scripts of forgotten origin

## usage

To install on a new machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/em-schmidt/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
./.dotfiles/install
```

Refresh periodically

```sh
dotfiles
```
