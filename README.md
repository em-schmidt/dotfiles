dotfiles revamp for 2021

These are *my* dotfiles.  I occasionally point people here for reference, but all the standard dotfiles caveats apply.... don't blindly clone this repo and use it... it won't work for you without modifications, and even if it did, it probably would be what you want. I also only ever test the bootstrapping when I get a new mac... so odds are that something has broken since I last tested.

I'm working on a mac generally and this repo is only used for that environment.

using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) instead of older scripts of forgotten origin

## usage

To install on a new machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/em-schmidt/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
./.dotfiles/install

Refresh periodically
